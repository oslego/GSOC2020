# DevTools: CSS Alignment Helpers

**Mentors:** Gabriel Luong, Razvan Caliman

**Email:** gl@mozilla.com, rcaliman@mozilla.com

## Project Description

There are many CSS properties and values to do alignment in the various CSS layout modules, like Flexbox and Grid. This can be overwhelming. It would help developers to have previews that illustrate the effect of alignment properties and values right in the autocomplete menu.
